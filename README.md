# YOLOv7-Swim-Pose-Recognition
This project aims to utilize (2023) YOLOv7's new pretrained pose recognition algorithm for both recognition and feedback of swimming "poses" (strokes). 

There are two main sections of code:
1. The Recognition Model
  - As of Summer 2023, several models have been tested:
        - Basic 5-9 layer 2D CNNs (with 3-5 Convolution layers respectively)
        - Basic 5-9 layer 3D CNNs (with 3-5 Convolution layers respectively)
        - ResNet with 2D Convolution layers
        - ResNet with 3D Convlution layers
    - 3 unique datasets have been created, all with roughly equal divisions in class.
    - The dataset includes 6 classes: Freestyle, Butterfly, Breaststroke, Backstroke, Underwater (Dolphin/Breastroke), and Diving
    - Frame batches of 32, 64, 128 were tested
    *More details can be found in the actual code itself. Refer to Inference Model.ipynb

Further investigation and manipulation of the YOLOv7 algorithm is planned. Due to time and resource constraints, will not be looking further into it for now.

2. The Feedback Algorithm
- The Feedback Algorithm will not use a ML-based approach, instead, will utilize the keypoints drawn by YOLOv7 to compare angles and relative positioning between joints.
  - Correct joint positioning will be hard coded, with an acceptable and unacceptable range.
