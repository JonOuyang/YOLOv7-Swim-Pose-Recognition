# YOLOv7-Swim-Pose-Recognition

#### Abstract:
Swim pose estimation and recognition is a challenging problem in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the body of the swimmer is continuously submerged under the water. The objective of this paper is to enhance existing ML models for estimating swim poses and for recognizing strokes to aide swimmers in pursuing a more perfect technique. We developed a novel methodology augmenting raw video data and adjusting a YOLOv7 base model to enhance swim pose estimation. We found the standard multi-class classification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to be insufficient for stroke recognition due to the similarity between strokes, so we designed a hierarchical binary classification tree using multiple ensembles of dense neural networks (DNN), CNN, and residual network (ResNET) models. Through these optimizations, the confidence level of pose estimation has increased by over 30%, and the ensembles of our recognition model has achieved approximately 80% accuracy. Fine-tuning of our recognition models and research combining joint keypoint coordinates with angle measurements as inputs could further increase the accuracy of our models.

#### NOTE: In swimming terms, "long axis strokes" refer to Freestyle and Backstroke; "short axis strokes" refer to Butterfly and Breastroke.

### Github Repository Notes:
For now, some of the code will be stored as Jupyter Notebooks. This will be converted to raw Python code upon acceptance and publishing of papers in conference preceedings (found in IEEE Xplore).

The YOLOv7 library is not included in source code and will require external installation. This may be changed in future versions of this repository.

There are two main sections:
## 1. The Recognition Model
  - Three primary model architectures were tested on the initial dataset:
        - 2D CNNs
        - 3D CNNs (2D casted into 3D where third dimension represents left vs right)
        - Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP)
        - ResNet with 2D Convolution layers
        - ResNet with 3D Convlution layers
    - 3 unique datasets have been created, all with roughly equal divisions in class.
    - The dataset includes 6 classes: Freestyle, Butterfly, Breaststroke, Backstroke, Underwater (Dolphin/Breastroke), and Diving
    - Frame batches of 32, 64, 128 were tested
    - 12 joint coordinate keypoints are used, all head keypoints are excluded through feature extraction. Encountered issues with head keypoints interfering with model accuracies.
    *More details can be found in the actual code itself. Refer to Inference Model.ipynb

### Classification Tree
1. The Recognition Tree consists of 2 primary layers. At the top layer, the input in form (1, 32, 12, 3) is fed into a binary classification hard voting ensemble, where 5 models guess whether the class is long axis vs short axis stroke, each guess counting as a single unweighted "vote". The majority of votes represents the final class that is guessed.
2. The second layer after the initial long axis vs short axis stroke recognition is 2 separate paths.
     a. The first path is the long axis path, where there is a singular DNN model to differentiate Freestyle vs Backstroke. Voting Ensemble in preliminary testing seemed to have no affect on accuracy. The 
     b. The second path is the short axis path, where there is a Soft Voting Ensemble, where 5 models returns its predictions in the form of confidence level (i.e. [0.7, 0.3] class 0 prediction), and the average confidence level for each class is calculated and the class with the overall highest confidence level is counted as the final guess. Significant improvement in accuracy was recorded.
3. After classification of stroke, the program will then execute its respective feedback functions, taking in the input as parameter for analysis
   
## 2. The Feedback Algorithm
- The Feedback Algorithm will not use a ML-based approach, instead, will utilize the keypoints drawn by YOLOv7 to compare angles and relative positioning between joints.
  - Correct joint positioning will be hard coded, with an acceptable and unacceptable range.
- The feedback functions are based on a calculated angle (degrees) between three joint coordinates
